# Reactive Examples

This repos contains a workspace with 3 examples projects, all using the same basic Sign-In view:
- One that implements the default `UIKit` approach
- One that implements it via ReactiveSwift
- One that implements it via RxSwift

This repos is to be used as an introduction to Functional Reactive Programming, and PRs are welcome if you wish to contribute to more frameworks (such as Combine).
